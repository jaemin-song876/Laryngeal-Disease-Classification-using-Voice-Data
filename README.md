# Laryngeal Disease Classification using Voice Data: Octave-band vs. Mel-Frequency Filters

This repository provides the code for our study on classifying laryngeal diseases using voice data, comparing the performance of Octave-band and Mel-frequency filters.

## Files
- **ofse_generation.py**: Preprocesses voice data with Octave Frequency Sub-band Energy (OFSE).
- **model.py**: Uses preprocessed data to train and classify laryngeal disease conditions.

## Usage
1. Run `ofse_generation.py` to preprocess the voice dataset using OFSE.
2. Input the preprocessed data into `model.py` for training and classification.

For questions or more information, please refer to our paper titled "*Laryngeal Disease Classification using Voice Data: Octave-band vs. Mel-Frequency Filters*."
